# Bank-Loan-Report

This Power BI report analyzes all loan applications 
from a banking institution during the year 2021.
In this report, I obtained information on the total 
number of loan applications made, the total amount financed, 
the amount received from approved loans, 
and the difference between approved loans (clients who repay loans granted by the bank) 
and delinquent loans (clients who do not repay loans).
This project also includes SQL queries to verify the values ​​in the final report.
